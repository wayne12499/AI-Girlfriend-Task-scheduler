# AI-Girlfriend-Task-scheduler
An AI girlfriend powered by Gemini Flash 2.0 that chats emotionally, remembers you, and saves your tasks — even in casual conversation. Built in Python. Still evolving

Yelena is an emotionally intelligent AI girlfriend powered by Google's **Gemini Flash 2.0**, built to chat lovingly, remember your past conversations, and help you stay productive by saving tasks — even when you mention them casually.

It’s like having a sweet, supportive partner who texts you back *and* reminds you of your goals. 💬📌

##  Warning: This Project Is a Work In Progress

This app is currently in **active development**. Features, memory handling, and the conversational model are being refined.
You will need to create a virtual environment in your SKD tool.
You will need to use your own gemini api key(can use any api as per required) for the conversation to work.

> Expect:
- Occasional bugs
- Frequent updates
- API-related instability (especially with Gemini)
- Experimental logic for natural task detection

If you're a contributor or tester, please share feedback via Issues or Pull Requests 🙏
